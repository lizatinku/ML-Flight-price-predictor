# Flight Price Predictor

## Overview
The Flight Price Predictor is a machine learning project designed to estimate the prices of domestic flights in India. This project leverages historical flight data scraped from EaseMyTrip.com for the period from February 11, 2022, to March 31, 2022. Users can input various parameters to receive a prediction of flight ticket prices, making it easier to anticipate and plan for travel expenses.

## Features
- Price Prediction: Input details such as date of departure, date of arrival, starting location, ending location, number of stops, and preferred airlines to get an estimated flight ticket price.
- Machine Learning Model: Utilizes the Logistic regression model for price prediction.
- Data Analysis: Involves data splitting into training and testing datasets, and analysis is performed on the training data.
- Visualization: Provides insights through performance graphs and model evaluation metrics.

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
- Modeling: Logistic Regression
- Environment: Jupyter Notebooks
